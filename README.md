Welcome Trinity Translators! In this page you will find information about Translating Trinity.

You can translate Trinity in any language and i will be more than happy to implement it to Trinity. There is just few things that you don't need to do while translating Trinity to your language.
Things like `{e}` or `+ i +` or emojis like `<:notdone:334852376034803714>`! Things like `"manageChannels":` etc.., don't need to be translated.

<h3>Formating</h3>
You will more likely to see:
`**This is a format**`
`*This is a format`
`**__This is a format__**`
`[Format this](https://but-not.this)`

Other things:
1. Don't translate the commands to your own language (commands like `ban`or like `welcomeset greetings`)
2. Command arguments like `<true|false>` shouldn't be translated at all.

Other things you should remember:
1. `:emojiName:`
2. `{user} or {server.name}`

Please make sure everything is right.

**Note:** If you don't understand anything or you need help feel free to DM ETLegacyâ„¢#9999 on Discord, if you are interested in joining the Translation team, DM me still.
